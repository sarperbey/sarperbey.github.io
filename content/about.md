This blog consist of random ramblings, bookmarks, interesting stuff that I cam across etc. Currently, I'm trying to gather all the stuff scattered around.

I might add some new functions in the future for separating English, Italian and Turkish entries.

This  blog created thanks to many open source projects. Framework by [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio), design template by [Athul](https://github.com/athul/archie).
